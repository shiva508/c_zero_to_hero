# Constants
### A constant is a literal numeric or character value, such as 5 or 'm'.
### All constants are of a particular data type; you can use type casting to explicitly specify the type of a constant, or let the compiler use the default type based on the value of the constant.
## 1.3.1 Integer Constants
### An integer constant is a sequence of digits, with an optional prefix to denote a number base.
## 1.3.2 Character Constants
### A character constant is usually a single character enclosed within single quotation marks, such as 'Q'. A character constant is of type int by default.
## 1.3.3 Real Number Constants
### A real number constant is a value that represents a fractional (floating point) number.
### It consists of a sequence of digits which represents the integer (or “whole”) part of the number, a decimal point, and a sequence of digits which represents the fractional part.
## 1.3.4 String Constants
### A string constant is a sequence of characters enclosed within double quotation marks, such as "Hello
### A string constant is a sequence of zero or more characters, digits, and escape sequences enclosed within double quotation marks. 
### A string constant is of type “array of characters”. All string constants contain a null termination character (\0) as their last character. 
### Strings are stored as arrays of characters, with no inherent size attribute. 
### The null termination character lets string-processing functions know where the string ends.
